    <p style="font-size:150%; color:orange;">A pioneer of the personal computer revolution, Bill Gates is known to be one of the most important programmers of the modern age.
      It was him who developed the first Windows computer back in 1985; a model that started off as just a way to compete with Apple's Macintosh, but grew steadily to eventually 
      become the most used computer operating system by far.
      <br/>
      It isn't a coincidence that the Windows operating system blew Apple out of the water.
