          Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group of programmers who
          computerized their school’s payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems to
          local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University, joined his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to
          develop software for the first microcomputers. They began by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language used on
          large computers, for use on microcomputers. With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year
          and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates’s sway over the infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft
          licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to International Business Machines Corporation—then the world’s biggest
          computer supplier and industry pacesetter—for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal computer). After the
          machine’s release in 1981, IBM quickly set the technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise pushed out
          competing operating systems. While Microsoft’s independence strained relations with IBM, Gates deftly manipulated the
          larger company so that it became permanently dependent on him for crucial software. Makers of IBM-compatible PCs, or
          clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic software. By the start of the 1990s he had become the PC industry’s
          ultimate kingmaker.
